- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sachinrajsharma, Mathematics Teacher, Social Worker ( Founder - Udgam Welfare Foundation - www.udgamwelfarefoundation.com,www.mathstudy.in & https://mathstudy.in ) 
- My Philosophy of Life : "Having faced lifeâ€™s challenges firsthand, I understand the transformative power of education. I believe it is the greatest equalizer. Through free coaching and a comprehensive digital platformâ€”offering tests, study materials, and video lectures at [www.udgamwelfarefoundation.com](http://www.udgamwelfarefoundation.com)â€”I strive to empower underprivileged students. For me, true education goes beyond academics; it nurtures both intellect and integrity, enabling individuals not only to uplift themselves but to inspire and elevate others with empathy, equity, and purpose.
- ðŸ‘€ I aim to create a global impact by building inclusive, tech-driven educational platforms that break financial and geographical barriers. Through [www.udgamwelfarefoundation.com](http://www.udgamwelfarefoundation.com), I envision empowering underserved learners worldwide with free access to quality resourcesâ€”nurturing minds, fostering equity, and shaping a generation driven by knowledge, compassion, and purpose.

- Recent Projects :

I have developed two educational websites aimed at democratizing learning for underprivileged students. The Digital Learning Platform [https://udgamwelfarefoundation.com](https://udgamwelfarefoundation.com/)  is a comprehensive hub offering free access to study material, e-books, video lectures, and online testsâ€”empowering students to prepare for competitive exams with quality resources. My second initiative, [https://www.mathstudy.in](https://mathstudy.in/), focuses on providing downloadable math e-books and LaTeX-based content for deeper conceptual learning. Both platforms are part of my mission to create inclusive, technology-driven education models that eliminate barriers of cost and accessibility, ensuring every learner, regardless of background, has the tools to succeed and grow.
